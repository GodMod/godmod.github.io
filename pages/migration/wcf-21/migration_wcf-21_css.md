The LESS compiler has been in use since WoltLab Community Framework 2.0, but was replaced with a SCSS compiler in WoltLab Suite 3.0. This change was motivated by SCSS becoming the de facto standard for CSS pre-processing and some really annoying shortcomings in the old LESS compiler.

The entire CSS has been rewritten from scratch, please read the [docs on CSS][view_css] to learn what has changed.
