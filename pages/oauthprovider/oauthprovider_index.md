## Introduction

The WSC OAuth-Provider allows your WSC installation to be an OAuth-Provider. Therefore other applications supporting OAuth can use your WSC installation for authentication of the users.

## Permissions

There are two group permissions:

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Can use OAuth | User | Allows an user to authorize applications |
| Can manage OAuth-Clients | Admin | Can manage OAuth-Clients |

## Security
Please use only encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) for accessing the OAuth-Endpoints, as personal information (e.g. email address) is transfered or can be accessed.
