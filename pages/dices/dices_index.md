## Introduction

This Plugins adds three dices. Each dice can be configured or enabled independently.
The random value is saved with the message, therefore a manipulation of the value is visible.

## Usage
To add the random value, just click on the BBCode-Button of the dice, or enter `[dice1][/dice1]` into the message.

## Settings

### BBCodes
At the BBCode Management, you can adjust the Button Values and Icons for dice1, dice2 and dice3.

### Dices
* Name - *The Name will be shown at the output of the random number*
* Lowest value - *The lowest value of the dice.*
* Highest value - *The highest value of the dice.*
* Enable dice - *This will not remove the BBCode-Button (you can do this at the BBCode-Management), but will prevent the generation of random numbers*
