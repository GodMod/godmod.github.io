## Introduction

This extension allows the 3rd Party Login (like Facebook or Google) for your WSC using an WSC OAuth Provider.


## Security
Please use only encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) for accessing the OAuth-Endpoints, as personal information (e.g. email address) is transfered or can be accessed.
Also, your WSC installation using the 3rd Party Login should only use an encrypted connection.
