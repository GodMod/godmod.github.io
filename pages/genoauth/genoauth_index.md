## Introduction

This extension allows the 3rd Party Login (like Facebook or Google) using an generic OAuth Provider.

## License
See [Commercial License](license_en.html).

## Security
Please use only encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) for accessing the OAuth-Endpoints, as personal information (e.g. email address) is transfered or can be accessed.
Also, your WSC installation using the 3rd Party Login should only use an encrypted connection.
